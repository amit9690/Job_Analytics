# Project Description 📁:

"Job Analyst" is a comprehensive data analysis project that aims to provide valuable insights into job vacancies sourced from the Instahyre website, a prominent job portal. This project was conceived and executed by a team of dedicated individuals, including Amit Porwal, Madhu Gupta, and Shubhum Pathak, under the expert guidance of Manish Hemnani.

## Project Phases:

### 1. Data Scraping 🔍: The project initiated with the collection of raw data from the Instahyre website. I extract data using BeautifullSoup and selenium libraries in python. This phase involved web scraping techniques to extract job-related information, ensuring the foundation for subsequent analysis was solid.

### 2. Data Cleaning 🧹: In the second phase, meticulous data cleaning procedures were implemented. This step was crucial in enhancing data quality by addressing inconsistencies and errors, thus preparing the dataset for accurate analysis. 


### 3. Data Preprocessing 🔧: The third phase of the project involved data preprocessing techniques. This step included data transformation, feature engineering, and handling missing values, making the dataset more amenable to analysis.

### 4. Data Modeling 📊 : To organize and structure the data effectively, the team created three key tables: jobs, company, and details. This data modeling step streamlined the analysis process, enabling efficient extraction of insights.

#### **I done step-2, step-3 and step-4 using power query in excel.**

### 5. SQL Queries 📈: To extract meaningful information from the structured data, MySQL queries were employed. These queries allowed the team to answer critical questions and discover trends within the job vacancies dataset.


### 6. Excel Dashboard 📄: The culmination of the project was the creation of an Excel dashboard specifically tailored to visualize job vacancies data. This dashboard provided an intuitive and user-friendly interface to explore the project's findings, making it accessible to a wider audience. This dashboard created using pivot table , power query and charts and graphs.
